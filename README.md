Unsupervised Learning with GANs 

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field, delivering on the promise of generative models in their ability to generate realistic examples across a range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks such as translating photos of summer to winter or day to night, and in generating photorealistic photos of objects, scenes, and people that even humans cannot tell are fake.

In this project I have used basic Gan model on the MNIST dataset obtaining practical knowledge and hands on experience of the basic concepts and structure of the Generative Adversarial Nets(GANs) implementing it with pytorch.
